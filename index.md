## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 7

    One of my favorite labs was lab 7 because the partner I got for that lab was a lot more well-versed in his knowledge of programming so he was able to help me and do basic coding so he could write stuff without me having to say what to write. Another reason it was my favorite lab is it could be useful to me in the future because I have trouble with the amount of time between two different dates.

Lab 12

    Another one of my favorite labs was lab 12. The reason why lab 12 was one of my favorites is the outcome of the lab is very beautiful and satisfying to look at. I also picked it because it was really good practice for learning how to use other people's functions/code without completely understanding how it works but still getting functioning code.
    
Lab 3

    My final favorite lab was lab three. Itâ€™s on this list because it was the lab where I really started to understand how to use git hub and what order to use the commands in. It is also where I learned that you can do things like git add (period) and it will just add all the files in the folder to be committed and pushed to git hub.
